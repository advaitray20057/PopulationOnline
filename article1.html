      As mentioned in the main page, the World population growth rate is 0.84%
      which is less than half of what it was 60 years ago at 2.1%. Now you may
      be wondering how did this happen and why. Firstly and the most important
      of all is a decline in the total fertility rate (TFR). The fertility rate
      is the average number children born per woman. Globally this number is 2.4
      but it varies from a high of 6.6 in Niger to a low of 1.1 in South Korea.
      Due to this huge variation the UN has set a replacement level for the TFR
      which is 2.1. Most developed countries have a TFR lower than 2.1 like the
      US at 1.8, the UK at 1.7, and Japan at a shockingly low 1.4 But you may be
      wondering how did this happen. Well firstly urbanization resulted in
      people having busier lives which meant not a lot of time to take care of
      children. Secondly, people were living longer. The life expectancy has
      increased from 53.1 years in 1962 to 71.7 years in 2022 and that meant
      that you can deliver babies later in life but that meant you could only
      have one or two children. The third and final reason is COVID-19 and
      that's because of the lockdowns because the parents could only take care
      of them because nobody could go outside.
