    <h1>China's three-child policy failed (again)</h1>

    After a failed two-child policy from 2015 to 2021, China's three-child
    policy failed again. But how is it defined that it failed or suceeded. Well,
    it all comes down to the fertility rate. According a CIA World Factbook
    report China's fertility rate in 2020 was 1.25, in 2021 it bounced to 1.6
    and in 2022 it again fell to 1.45. According a UN report China's fertility
    rate in 2020 was 1.28, in 2021 it fell to 1.16 and 2022 it bounced to 1.18.
    The World Bank claims it has been steady at 1.7 since 2020. But you may be
    wondering why did they fail. Firstly, the one-child policy was implemented
    from 1980 to 2015. That is 35 years of couples only being able to have a
    single child. But why did implement this in the first place. The reason is
    back then China's population growth rate was 1.3% which is significantly
    higher than what it is now at 0.1% so they needed to control the population
    growth to do their "reform and opening-up" to increase the GDP.
